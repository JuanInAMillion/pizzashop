Jose Roni Pizza Shop
Our pizza shop will allows users to browse our menu online and order a pizza if desired. They will be able to add or remove items to a shopping cart and place an order. Orders can be placed with a user account (optional goal of allowing guest users to checkout).  The user has an ability to login, create an account, and logout. Users can create an account with a username, password, street address, phone number, and credit card number for expedited checkout. The user will be able to view the estimated arrival time for their order and can view order history and pending orders. Each item will be provided with an example picture for the product for the customer's reference. This project will be developed using Angular, so it will be a single-page application with routing implemented in the HTML templates for redirecting the user. Our backend will be developed using Hibernate, Spring Boot, Spring Data and a REST web service. The database will be Postgres through DBeaver.
